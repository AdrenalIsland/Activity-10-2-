## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: \# Section 2: Diamond Prices

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Load required packages
library(ggplot2)
# Sample data for demonstration
diamonds_data <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]
# Create a scatterplot of diamond prices
ggplot(diamonds_data, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Carat", y = "Price")  #Labels

#Summary Table
library(ggplot2)               # loading package
data(diamonds)                 # loading dataset
library(dplyr)                 # loading package
statistics <- diamonds %>%     # Group the data by the 'cut'
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarise(
    Count = n(),      # Calculate the count of observations in each group
    Min = min(depth),
    Q1 = quantile(depth, 0.25), #Calculating 1st quartile(25th percentile)
    Median = median(depth),
    Q3 = quantile(depth, 0.75), #Calculating 3rd quartile(75th percentile)
    Max = max(depth),
    Mean = mean(depth),
    SD = sd(depth)
  )

print(statistics)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```         
# Section 3: Course Learnings

# In this course, I've learned various concepts related to data analysis, statistics, and R programming,these include:
# writing code that works and is readable to others.
# understanding data visualization techniques.
# gaining practical experience with R packages and tools.
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
